Note about sound files
======================

The actual data generated by participants consists of audio files in which
their answers after each trial were recorded (repetition of the verbs after
holding them in memory for 6 seconds). This data is not shared here because
sound files can be used to identify individual people and, thus, publicly
sharing them conflicts with current data storing policy. The actual data on
which all analyses are run consist of our transcription of these sound files.
Note that we ran inter-rater reliability analyses and also documented the
guidelines that were used for the transcription of the audio files. These
are all shared in this repository.
